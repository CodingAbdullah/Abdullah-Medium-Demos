# Bittensor — Decentralized Incentives for Machine Intelligence

Bittensor is a non-EVM Layer-1 blockchain designed to coordinate, evaluate, and reward useful off-chain machine intelligence in a decentralized way.

## Key Features

- **Subnets**  
  Incentivized marketplaces (SNx) that provide AI-related services such as inference, analytics, and decentralized compute.

- **Root Subnet (SN0)**  
  The core subnet responsible for TAO issuance and weighting the importance of all other subnets.

- **Miners**  
  Nodes that perform useful work defined by subnet-specific goals, such as running models or serving inference.

- **Validators**  
  Nodes that evaluate miner outputs using subnet-specific evaluation functions and assign rewards.

- **Yuma Consensus**  
  A protocol-level mechanism that aggregates validator evaluations to fairly distribute rewards across miners and subnets.

- **TAO Token (τ)**  
  The native token used for staking, delegation, and incentivizing participation across the network.

- **Subnet Tokens (Alpha Tokens)**  
  Optional, subnet-specific tokens used to further incentivize activity within individual subnets.

- **Decentralized AI Infrastructure**  
  Enables permissionless access to AI services without relying on centralized compute providers or API keys.
